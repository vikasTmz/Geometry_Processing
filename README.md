# Mesh Operations: Geometry Processing

Part of [Brown University CSCI2240](https://dritchie.github.io/csci2240/) assignment.


## Description

This project contains code to perform Mesh operations written in C++ and was built on top of the Stencil code provided to
us by the instructors of CSCI2240. Implemented Loop Subdivision, Garland and Heckbert simplification and Iso Remeshing supported by half edge datastructure.
